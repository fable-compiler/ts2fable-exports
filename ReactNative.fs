/// For example, the app needs to determine if the touch is scrolling, sliding on a widget, or tapping.
/// This can even change during the duration of a touch. There can also be multiple simultaneous touches.
///

/// without any additional knowledge about their parent or child components.

///       Cancel-ability- when making an action, the user should be able to abort it mid-touch by dragging their finger away
